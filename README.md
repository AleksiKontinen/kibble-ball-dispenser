# kibble-ball-dispenser
Automated cat feeder that drops kibble filled puzzle balls

# description
3D-printed kibble ball dispenser controlled via attiny85 + esp32 server. Esp32 gets time and host control server via wifi.
Cat puzzle balls, whole feeder, and case for the esp32 are 3D-printed.

# conclusion 
Changing load in the drum and poor motor choice led to non-stabile function. Good for proof of concept but needs redesing.
